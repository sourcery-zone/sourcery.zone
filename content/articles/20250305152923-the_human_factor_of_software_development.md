## Intro {#intro}

Innovation. A word that dominates discussions in the software
industry. But today, I want to focus on something different: the human
factor.


## Greed, a Feature of The System {#greed-a-feature-of-the-system}

A software consultancy charges its client around a million euros to
develop the MVP of a project—a web and mobile application consisting
of just three components—over a period of six months. The catch? The
scope of work is so simple that I estimate it could be completed in
just three weeks. There's no need for UI/UX design, authentication,
user management, subscription handling, or any other complex
functionality. Most of it is just integrating existing solutions
already used in other applications developed for the client.

And yet, this kind of bloated project timeline and pricing is not an
anomaly. It's a feature of the system.


## The Dehumanization of Engineering {#the-dehumanization-of-engineering}

Consultancies and even internal engineers often end up dehumanizing
each other—not out of necessity, but as a tactic to claim a larger
share of the rewards or climb the corporate ladder. This fosters a
culture where engineers are forced to develop a different kind of
skill: not technical mastery, but the ability to generate persuasive
nonsense in polished PowerPoint slides.

This is not an unfortunate side effect; it’s an accepted norm.

I first encountered the idea of software development as a social
activity in **[Your Code as a Crime Scene](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime2/your-code-as-a-crime-scene-second-edition/)**. It struck me as an obvious
truth—software development is a human-driven process, like any other
endeavor undertaken by social beings. But here’s the problem: when
this human factor is left unchecked or becomes toxic, it can actively
harm the development process rather than enhance it.


## The AI Mirage and the Crisis of Trust {#the-ai-mirage-and-the-crisis-of-trust}

The industry is buzzing with excitement about a future where AI
replaces software engineers entirely. The dream is simple: AI gets
smart enough to solve all problems engineers currently tackle, and
does so at a fraction of the cost.

At this stage, I’m not interested in debating whether that future is
feasible. What concerns me is **why** so many are rooting for it. Why has
the industry lost so much trust in engineers?

Like any dysfunctional system, the problem isn’t isolated to a single
flaw. You can’t point at one issue—whether it’s inflated timelines,
bureaucratic inefficiencies, or misleading presentations—and expect
fixing it will heal everything. Dysfunction feeds on itself, creating
a cycle of corruption.


## A Broken Feedback Loop {#a-broken-feedback-loop}

Much like a failing government, once certain behaviors—mismanagement,
inflated claims, and performative competition—become normalized, they
generate a feedback loop that pulls more people into the problem. The
longer this cycle continues, the harder it becomes to break free from
it.

We see the evidence everywhere. From technical decisions that
prioritize control over progress, as described in [We Are Destroying
Software](https://antirez.com/news/145), to the endless drama unfolding in open-source
communities. The signs are clear: mutual understanding is eroding,
replaced by mistrust and performative competition.

The software industry is no longer primarily about nurturing
innovation for the sake of advancement. Instead, it’s caught in a
cycle of repetition, reinforcing power structures and profit
motives. And that, more than any technical debt, is what’s corrupting
everything.


## Where Do We Go from Here? {#where-do-we-go-from-here}

So what’s the solution? The first step is recognizing that this isn’t
just an engineering problem—it’s a systemic one. Real innovation won’t
come from AI replacing engineers or from the latest hyped-up
framework. It will come from rebuilding trust and reshaping the
incentives that drive the industry.

More than anything, we need to rekindle the hacker spirit—an ethos
built on curiosity, ingenuity, and a relentless desire to push
boundaries, not for profit, but for the sheer joy of problem-solving
and discovery. The hacker culture has always been about breaking
barriers, questioning norms, and building better systems—not just more
profitable ones. If the software industry wants to escape its
self-destructive cycle, it must embrace the mindset of those who see
code as a means of empowerment, not exploitation. Only then can we
return to an engineering culture that values real progress over
performative success.
