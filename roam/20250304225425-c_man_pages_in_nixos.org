Well, this one is simple. I was reading [[https://beej.us/guide/bgc/][Beej's guide to C programming]],
and learned it's possible to read C compiler's documentation using man
pages like:

#+begin_src bash
man 3 printf
#+end_src

But to my surprise I got:

#+begin_src text
‚ùØ man 3 printf
No manual entry for printf in section 3
#+end_src

And it turned out to enable it, I needed to, add the following
packages to my system:

#+begin_src nix
glibcInfo  # look out for the capital `I`
man-pages
#+end_src
